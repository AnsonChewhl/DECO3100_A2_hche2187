					<h2>Take a guess... How long does it take to decompose plastic? </h2>
					<p>The Australia Bureau of Statistics shows that <strong>only 3%</strong> of the waste in the landfill is plastic waste. However, as suggested by Goodfor Company, it can take up to <strong>450 years</strong> to decompose a plastic bag. Additionally, <strong>less than 10%</strong> of the consumed plastic was recycled (McLaren). The low recycling rate means there was a high proportion sent to landfill, or was left on the land and ocean.</p>

					<p>Have you ever seen any plastic bottles when walking on the beach? Where do you think they came from? It’s common to see plastic floating in the ocean but no one may report it. Thus, the amount of plastic in surface waters is not very well known. However, in estimation, Our World In Data reported that the amount ranges from 10,000 to 100,000 tonnes. Let’s check how much mismanaged plastic waste (MPW) each person was responsible for in different countries.</p>

					<h2>Endangered aquatic species are threatened with extinction</h2>
					<p>There are aquatic species’ (animals that live in water) populations decreasing at an alarming rate and being considered endangered (facing a very high risk of extinction). “Fishes” is the only animal group that has over 3000 endangered animals. Numerous causes devastate their population, such as climate change and water pollution. IUCN revealed that Plastic pollution is threatening their size as it degrades the water quality. <br> <br> The data from 2012 to 2021 was collected and used linear regression to predict the potential number of threatened species in the future. The predictions are mostly lining up with the actual value in 2022. However, most of them have underestimated the actual value in 2022. Thus, we should consider this, especially since the amount of threatened species has a high risk of rising.</p>

Additionally, according to Condor Ferries, over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine species die from plastic pollution every year. Ocean Conservancy added that plastic has been found in more than 60% of all seabirds and in 100% of sea turtles species that mistake plastic for food.</p>

					<h2>An increasing demand for seafood worldwide</h2>
					<p>As you can see from the data below, our demand for seafood has been increasing throughout the past thirty years. Undoubtedly, this uptrend will continue in the future. Besides, we should notice this as a signal that we have to keep the marine clean and safe. It is because there is evidence that microplastics and nanoplastics (tiny, almost undetectable, pieces of plastic) can move from a fish’s stomach to its muscle tissue. McInturf & Savoca mentioned that this is the part that we typically eat. </p>

					<p>As we are subjected to long-term exposure to nanoplastics at low concentrations, it is hard to tell the impact of consuming fish with little nanoplastics inside. However,  Lai et al. study showed that excessive nanoplastics intake will destroy our cell membrane structure leading to cell death. Also, Domenech et al. reported that it may accumulate in different organs and tissues and may induce in the long term the development of cancer.</p>

					<h2>So, what can we do?</h2>
					<p>Everyone can do something to help solve the plastic pollution problem, and a lot of people
						worldwide are already taking action to lower their plastic use. It’s not necessary to spend any

						the ocean, which protects the biodiversity of marine species. We can achieve this by focusing on
						the first of the 3Rs (reducing, reusing and recycling).</p>
