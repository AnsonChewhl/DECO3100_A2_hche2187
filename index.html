					<h2> Take a guess... How long does it take to decompose plastic? </h2>
					<p>Although only <strong>only 3%</strong> of the waste in the landfill is plastic waste (Australia
						Bureau of Statistics, 2020), it can take up to <strong>450 years</strong> to decompose a plastic
						bag (Goodfor Company, n.d.). Additionally, <strong>less than 10%</strong> of the consumed
						plastic was recycled (McLaren, 2021). The low recycling rate means there was a high proportion
						sent to landfill, or was left on the land and ocean.</p>

					<p>Have you ever seen any plastic bottles when walking on the beach? Where do you think they came
						from? It’s common to see plastic floating in the ocean and no one may report it. Thus, the
						amount of plastic in surface waters is not very well known. However, in estimation, the amount
						ranges from 10,000 to 100,000 tonnes (Our World In Data, n.d.). Let’s check how much MPW (mismanaged 
						plastic waste) each country emitted in 2021.</p>

					<p>There are aquatic species’ (animals that live in water) population decreasing at an alarming rate
						and being considered endangered (facing a very high risk of extinction). Fishes are the only
						animal groups that have over 3000 species threatened with extinction. Numerous causes devastate
						their population, such as climate change and water pollution. Plastic pollution is threatening
						their

						<h2>Most of the threatened aquatic species' population is decreasing</h2>
						<p>Due to plastic waste being emitted to the ocean, the loggerhead sea turtles (the world's
							largest hard-shelled turtle) are listed as endangered. Additionally, according to Condor
							Ferries (n.d.), over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 marine species die from plastic
							pollution every year. Plastic has been found in more than 60% of all seabirds and in 100% of
							sea turtles species that mistake plastic for food (Ocean Conservancy, n.d.). <br> <br>
							Besides that, there are a number of whales threatened by plastic pollution, such as blue
							whales, the largest animal known to ever exist. How are they affected? ABC news (2018)
							reported that a sperm whale was washed up on a beach in Spain and died due to nearly 30 kg
							of trash, including plastic, that blocked its digestive system.</p>

					<h2>An increasing demand for seafood worldwide</h2>
					<p>As you can see from the data below, our demand for seafood has been increasing throughout the
						past thirty years. Undoubtedly, this uptrend will continue in the future. Besides, we should
						notice this as a signal that we have to keep the marine clean and safe. It is because there is
						evidence that microplastics and nanoplastics (tiny, almost undetectable, pieces of plastic) can
						move from a fish’s stomach to its muscle tissue, which is the part that we typically eat
						(McInturf & Savoca, 2019).</p>

					<p>As we are subjected to long-term exposure to nanoplastics at low concentrations, it is hard to
						tell the impact of consuming fish with little nanoplastics inside. However, a study showed that
						excessive nanoplastics intake will destroy our cell membrane structure leading to cell death
						(Lai et al, 2022). Also, it may accumulate in different organs and tissues and may induce in the
						long term the development of cancer (Domenech et al, 2023).</p>

					<h2> So, what can we do? </h2>
					<p>Everyone can do something to help solve the plastic pollution problem, and a lot of people
						worldwide are already taking action to lower their plastic use. It’s not necessary to spend any
						to help address the plastic waste issue. Waste minimization can reduce plastic waste emitted to
						the ocean, which protects the biodiversity of marine species. We can achieve this by focusing on
						the first of the 3Rs (reducing, reusing and recycling).</p>
