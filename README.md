# Preparation
Please use **index.html** as the entry point of the website. Additionally, this website was designed to best fit the experience of a screen with a 1920x948 ratio. Besides, it was also responsible for other screen sizes (including tablet and mobile). However, some functions may be limited for mobile, e.g. hovering. Thus, it is recommended to use a **desktop** to view this website for the best experience
